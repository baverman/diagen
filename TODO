# TODO

* Typed rule value setter (it seems it's possible to use default total typed dict)
* Explicit port order control
* Refine grid-col rule. a:b syntax should have slice semantic, a/b should have start/length semantic.
* Export all edge UI styles as tags
* Create some diagrams
* Type node factory call args
