# TODO

* Nested subgrids.
* Node *N visual stacks (resolve naming conflict with existing stack primitive)
* Create some diagrams
* Z-index. Children should inherit parent's depth.

# Investigate
* Use absolute coordinates for node. Relative coordinates is a backend implementation detail.
* Rework origin to include it into positioning as late as possible
* Wrap nodes
