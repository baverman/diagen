# TODO

* Add span-[col-spec][/row-spec] where spec is {N|:M|:-L|:} where N is relative,
  M is absolute, L relative from end, : all width. It could be useful and more readeable
  to use `cell-1/2 span-2/2` instead of `cell-1+2/2+2`. Maybe it's a good idea to
  remove later option and rename `cell` into `at`.
* Subgrids. For actual span it could use node span defined by props.grid_at.
* Wrap nodes
* Node *N visual stacks (resolve naming conflict with existing stack primitive)
* Create some diagrams

# Investigate
#
* Rework origin to include it into positioning as late as possible
