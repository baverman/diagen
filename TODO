# TODO

* Export all edge UI styles as tags
  - sourcePerimeterSpacing/targetPerimiterSpacing
  - jumpStyle/jumpSize

* Create some diagrams

# Investigate

* Lazy node/edges styles to get opportunity to adjust drawio lists, for example extend arrow styles?
* I don't like current approach with proplist to only aid tests. Props resolution
  should be local and predictable. Either use only prop lists and allow root property changes. Or use
  precalculated props (I prefer this approach, it allows styles to depend on existing values and do not
  think about sudden root changes) but it need to fix tests.
* Consider to use frozen dataclass for props. It would allow to remove copy on every access.
