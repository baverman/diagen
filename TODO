# TODO

* Export all edge UI styles as tags
  - sourcePerimeterSpacing/targetPerimiterSpacing
  - jumpStyle/jumpSize

* Merge props in factories as they go. To avoid O(N^2) calculations.
* Use percent values for label offsets. It's quite awkward to use float numbers.
* Create some diagrams
* Type node factory call args
* Lazy node/edges styles to get opportunity to adjust drawio lists, for example extend arrow styles?
